## ServiceCollection extension

In addition to the generated services, there is another class generated by the source generator. This is an extension class for IServiceCollection that registers all generated services with the dependency injection container.

```csharp
using SampleProject.Services;
using AutoDependencies.Attributes;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using SampleProject.Interfaces.Generated;

namespace SampleProject.Extensions.Generated
{
    [Generated]
    public static class SampleProjectServiceCollectionExtensions
    {
        public static IServiceCollection RegisterServicesFormSampleProject(this IServiceCollection services, ServiceLifetime lifetime)
        {
            services.Add(new ServiceDescriptor(typeof(ISampleService), typeof(SampleService), lifetime));
            return services;
        }
    }
}
```

This extension method accepts a `ServiceLifetime` so that you can specify the lifetime of your services yourself.

Class and method names generates based on assembly name.
